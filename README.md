Py3dns Changes for Windows Usage

The credit goes to anyone who for fixing Py3dns so that it worked for windows ( not really a strong programmer so I couldn't made huge changes like other people did)

I just made a small edit of changing the self.async to self.py3async and then it worked for me

Hope this helps windows user so that they can use DNS
